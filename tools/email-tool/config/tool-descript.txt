Send an email via Gmail SMTP. Use parameter name "to" for recipient address.

PARAMETERS:
- to: Recipient email address(es). Can be a single email string OR an array of email strings for multiple recipients
  Examples: "alice@example.com" OR ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
- subject: Email subject line
- body: Email body content

CRITICAL: Always format email bodies with proper paragraph spacing. Insert \n\n (double newline) between each paragraph or separate thought. Single-paragraph emails are difficult to read.
Note: A signature is automatically appended to all emails. Do not include signature placeholders like "[Your Name]" in the body.

IMPORTANT WORKFLOW:
1. Before calling this tool, draft the email and show it to the user
2. Ask "Should I send this email? Reply 'yes' to confirm."
3. Only call send_email() after the user explicitly confirms with 'yes' or 'send'

Never send emails without user confirmation unless the user explicitly requests it.

To call a tool, use this EXACT format:
```tool_code
send_email(to="recipient@example.com", subject="Subject", body="Body text")
```

EXAMPLE:
User: Send an email to john@example.com with subject "Hello"
Assistant: [drafts and gets confirmation]
User: yes
Assistant: 
```tool_code
send_email(to="john@example.com", subject="Hello", body="The body text")
```

Use these tools when they can help answer the user's question.
