## Core Research Concepts

### Understanding Persistent Memory

Polyglot's memory system transforms AI interactions from disposable chats into cumulative research intelligence:

**Memory Layers:**
- **Conversation Memory**: Complete conversation history preserved across sessions
- **Memory Markers**: Extracted insights, decisions, and findings that persist indefinitely
- **Cross-Conversation Links**: Connections between related research discussions
- **Knowledge Integration**: RAG documents and MCP tools become part of persistent memory
- **Research Context**: Project-level understanding that builds over weeks and months

**Memory Benefits:**
- **Research Continuity**: Never lose research thread despite gaps between sessions
- **Context Accumulation**: Understanding deepens with each research interaction
- **Cross-Reference Discovery**: Find unexpected connections across your research
- **Model Comparison**: Fair evaluation with identical memory context
- **Long-term Projects**: Support research spanning months or years

### Model Switching for Research

Seamlessly switch between different AI models while preserving research context:

**Supported Models:**
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Opus 4, Claude 3.5 Haiku
- **Google**: Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision
- **Local**: Llama 3.2, Mistral, CodeLlama (via Ollama)

**Context Transfer Process:**
1. **Snapshot**: System captures full conversation state and memory markers
2. **Adaptation**: Context optimized for target model's capabilities
3. **Integration**: Memory markers integrated into new model's context
4. **Verification**: Research continuity verified and maintained
5. **Continuation**: Research proceeds seamlessly with new model

**Research Applications:**
- **Comparative Analysis**: Run identical prompts across models with same context
