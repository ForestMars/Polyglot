## Memory Architecture

Polyglot treats memory as a controlled research variable, not a hidden feature:

- Conversation Memory: Every chat thread persists indefinitely and can be referenced across sessions
- Cross-Model Context: Switch from GPT to Claude mid-conversation while maintaining full context
- Knowledge Integration: Your documents and tools become part of the AI's accessible memory
- Research Continuity: Long-term projects build context over time

## The Research Environment

- Model Comparison: Run identical prompts across different AI models with identical memory context to evaluate performance objectively.
- Knowledge Augmentation: Integrate your documents (RAG) so AI responses are grounded in your specific knowledge base rather than generic training data.
- Tool Integration: Connect external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give AI models access to real-time data and capabilities.
- Private Data Control: Everything runs locally first, with optional synchronization that you control.
