## Get Your Research Environment Running (3 minutes)
```git clone https://github.com/ForestMars/Polyglot.git
   cd Polyglot && npm install && npm run dev```

## Your First Research Session (2 minutes)

- Start a conversation: Open http://localhost:3000, create new chat
- Test memory persistence: Close browser, reopen - your conversation is still there
- Switch models: Try the same prompt with different AI models, notice how context carries over
- Add knowledge: (Coming soon) Upload a document to see RAG integration

## Understanding Memory Control (1 minute)
Unlike standard AI chat tools, every interaction in Polyglot builds your controlled knowledge base:

- Conversations persist across browser sessions
- Context maintains when switching between AI models
- You control what knowledge gets integrated and how
