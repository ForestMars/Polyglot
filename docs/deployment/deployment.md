  }
};
```

### Static Hosting for Research Teams

```bash
# Vercel deployment with research optimizations
vercel --prod --env VITE_RESEARCH_MODE=true

# Netlify deployment with large storage allocation
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --functions=research-functions

# AWS S3 + CloudFront for research organization
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://research-ai-workspace --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id RESEARCH_DIST_ID --paths "/*"
```

### Custom Domain for Research Environment

```bash
# Configure custom domain for research team
# Example: ai-research.university.edu

# SSL certificate for research data security
certbot --nginx -d ai-research.university.edu

# Security headers for research environment
# nginx configuration
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdnjs.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" always;
```
